Project for masterâ€™s thesis which entails conducting an analysis and comparison of two popular Java
frameworks for web application development: Spring and Quarkus. The aim of the study
was to provide software developers and architects with the necessary information to make an
informed technological choice. To perform the comparison, two very simple and identical applications were
created, each using one of the frameworks. Additionally, native versions of the applications
were implemented using the GraalVM tool. The comparison was conducted based on response time latency, CPU and memory utilization, image size, startup time, and build time.
Docker was used to set up the testing environment, and the wrk2 and VisualVM tools were
employed for conducting tests and measuring results.
